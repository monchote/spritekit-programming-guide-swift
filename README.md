Sprite Kit Programming Guide port to Swift
==========================================

Swift port of the [Sprite Kit Programming Guide by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html)

This is a very basic project to get hands-on Sprite Kit and learn the basics. I thought it'd be a good exercise to port it from Objective-C to practise my recently-acquired Swift skills.

It consists of a couple of `SKScene` and a bunch of `SKSpriteNode` animated with `SKAction` and `SKPhysicsBody`.
